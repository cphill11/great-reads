## Description 
MERN stack book search engine designed for users who enjoy reading and will search for books to interact with them, as well as to leave recommendations for others to read.

Loading the search engine presents the user with a menu containing the options to Search for Books, Login or Signup, and an input field to search for books with a visible submit button.

Clicking on the Search for Books menu option presents the user with an input field to search for books and a submit button.

Logged out users are able to enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button, which then presents the user with several search results.  Results feature a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.

Clicking on the Login/Signup menu option triggers the appearance of a modal on the screen with a toggle to select between the option to Login / Signup.

Should the user select Signup, the user is presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, a password, and a signup button.   Should the user select Login, the user is presented with inputs for an email address, a password, and login button.  Entering a valid email address, creating a password and clicking on the signup button creates a user account, logging the user into the site. 

When the user enters the email address and password for an account, then clicks on the login button, the modal closes and the user is logged into the site. 

Once logged into the site, menu options change to Search for Books, an option to See Saved Books, and Logout.  Entering a search term in the input field and clicking the submit button presents the user with several search results.  Each result features a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.  Additionally, a button to save a book to my account as either read, reading, or plan to read is presented to the user.

Selecting a filter shows the user books with those filters.  Clicking on the Save button for a book saves that book’s information is to the user account as read, reading or plan to read.  Clicking on the option to see my saved books presents the user with all of the books I have saved to my account, each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site as well as a button to remove a book from the user's account.

Clicking on a book presents the user with a forum to leave comments about the book and reply to others comments.  Clicking on the Remove button on a book deletes the book from the saved books list.  Clicking on the Logout button logs the user out of the site and presents the uswer with a menu including the options to Search for Books, Login/Signup, and an input field to search for books with a submit button.
